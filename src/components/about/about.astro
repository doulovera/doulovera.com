      <p>
        I'm passionate about programming and improving lives through technology. I
        like learning new things that can help me to improve my skills and
        knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started coding when I was 14 years old, creating a Discord bot for
        personal purposes. Then I discovered my love in Web Development, learning
        as much HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I can, then looking at Front-end
        frameworks like Vue and React.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Now, I'm studying to become a Systems Engineer at the university, while
        keep learning about Web Development and other technologies in the
        Internet.
