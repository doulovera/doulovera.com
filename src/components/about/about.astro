      <p>
        I've been working professionally in programming since 2021,
        but my passion began when I was 14 years old, creating
        Discord bots and websites for my friends and myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        My motivation is to create products that creates value and
        keep up with the advancement of new technologies. I enjoy
        contributing to projects that improve people's lives.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Regarding my personal and professional interests, I read books
        on various topics; my favorite author is Julio RamÃ³n Ribeyro. I
        also like to attend cultural and tech events in my city. Professionally, I spend a
        significant part of my day integrating and improving features at work
        and developing my personal projects.
