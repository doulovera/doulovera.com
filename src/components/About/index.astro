    <h2>ðŸ‘‹ My name is Douglas Lovera...</h2>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about programming and improving lives through technology.
      I like learning new things that can help me to improve my skills and knowledge. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I started coding when I was 14 years old, creating a Discord bot for 
      personal purposes. Then I discovered my love in Web Development,
      learning as much HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I can, then looking at
      Front-end frameworks like Vue and React.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Now, I'm studying to become a Systems Engineer at the university,
      while keep learning about Web Development and other technologies in the 
      Internet.
